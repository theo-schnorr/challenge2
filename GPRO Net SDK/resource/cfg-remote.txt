# Remote Debugging Configuration
# Provided by Daniel S. Buckstein
# Only the first line of this file is used, and must have one of the following formats: 
#	computername
#	ipaddress
#	computername:port
#	ipaddress:port
# Descriptions: 
#	"computername" is the name of the target machine for remote debugging
#	"ipaddress" is the IP address of the target machine for remote debugging
#	"port" is the port opened by the remote debugger on the target machine
# If one of the above formats does not work, use a different format.
#	(e.g. cannot find target machine by name, use remote's IP address)
# Pro tip: remote debugger also works locally if one of the following is used: 
#	computername of the local machine
#	localhost
#	127.0.0.1
